# UCF_homework_week4

This homework assignment is to make a game called crystal collector.
The computer picks a "Target Score" for you to attempt to match.  
Each crystal has a numeric value.  
As you click on each crystal, "Your Score" will increase. 
If you match the target, you win.  If you go over your lose.

A page design is needed that will have clickable images of 4 crystals.
    Each crystal will need to have a rondom value between 1-12 assigned before each game
4 numeric displays that keep track of : Target Score (which needs to be randomly generated)
    Current score which needs to be zeroed befor each game and adds cumulativly the cristal scores as the are pressed
    Wins a straght counter
    Losses a straight counter
Logic to compare Target score agains the current score
    if the they are equal === "alert you win" and increment wins
    reset the game
    if current score exceeds target "alert you lose" and increments loses
    reset the game
